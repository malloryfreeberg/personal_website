## Hello!

I am the Coordinator for the [European Genome-phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/) (EGA), a controlled access resource for managing sensitive human data jointly run by EMBL-EBI and the Centre for Genomic Regulation. In my role, I am responsible for overall delivery of EGA services and coordinating the EGA roadmap with external project partners. Prior to becoming Coordinator, I was the Project Lead for coordinating the archiving and distribution of whole genome sequencing data from the UK Biobank resource. I joined EMBL-EBI in 2017 as part of the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) Data Coordination Platform team, where I developed the HCA metadata standard and worked closely with data generators to submit the first single cell sequencing datasets to the HCA.

After completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Bioinformatics at Saint Vincent College, I earned my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan studying post-transcriptional gene regulation in the model organisms _C. elegans_ (nematode) and _S. cerevisiae_ (budding yeast). In nematodes, I studied mechanisms and expression of small, regulatory RNAs including microRNAs and germline-specific piRNAs. In both nematodes and budding yeast, I studied protein-RNA interactions and how they contribute to post-transcriptional gene regulation. I then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins University, continuing my exploration of protein-RNA interactions through reanalysis of published deep sequencing data. Additionally, I piloted experiments to directly sequence full-length messenger RNAs in nematodes using nanopore sequencing technologies to explore the diversity of the nematode transcriptome.
